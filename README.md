# CS188 Artificial Intelligence (in progress)
An introductory course to AI.

### The Pac-Man Project in Python
Apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man.
This project covers foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.

## 1  Search
These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Uniformed-cost Search
* A* Search
* Admissible Heuristics for optimal Search

## 2  Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. 
* Reflex Agent
* Minimax Search
* Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Expectimax Search
* Evaluation Function

## 3  Reinforcement Learning
Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
* Value Iteration
* Policies
* Asynchronous Value Iteration
* Prioritized Sweeping Value Iteration
* Q-Learning

## 4  Probabilistic inference
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world.
* Exact Inference
* Approximate Inference
* Joint Particle Filter
